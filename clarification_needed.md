## Clarification Needed

I notice that the problem statement "modify the files acording to that" (note: contains typo in "acording") requires more specifics to proceed with any changes. To help you effectively, please provide:

1. Which specific files need to be modified
2. What changes need to be made to these files
3. The goal or purpose of these modifications

The workspace contains both frontend and backend code with:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript application (React 18.2.0, TypeScript 4.8.4)
- Backend: AWS CDK infrastructure (CDK 2.79.1)

I see several potential areas that could be modified:
1. React/TypeScript frontend application code
2. Frontend dependencies and configurations
3. AWS CDK infrastructure code
4. Backend dependencies and configurations
5. Build and deployment scripts

However, without knowing which of these areas needs modification and what changes are required, I cannot proceed with making changes.

Please specify what aspects need to be modified so I can assist you properly. When providing clarification, it would be helpful to know:

1. What "that" refers to in "modify the files according to that"
2. Any specific features or functionality you want to add/modify
3. Any specific dependencies or versions that need updating
4. Any particular coding standards or patterns to follow
