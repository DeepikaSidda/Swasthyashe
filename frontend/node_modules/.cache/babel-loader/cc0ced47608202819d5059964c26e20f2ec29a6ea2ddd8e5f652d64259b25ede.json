One fine day, I noticed something unusual on my clothes. Confused and scared, I didn’t know what was happening. Afraid of how my mom might react, I quietly hid the stained clothes under the old washing cloths and went to school, trying to pretend like everything was normal.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"text-gray-800 text-sm mb-4\">\n              But moms always know. She noticed the hidden clothes and, understanding what had happened, rushed to my school. She brought me back home, her face filled with concern and care. I remember her explaining things to me, though at that time, I was too young to fully grasp it all. Being in just the 5th grade, I followed her instructions like a robot, doing as she said without really understanding why.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"text-gray-800 text-sm mb-4\">\n              It was only years later that I truly understood what had happened that day—on 11th November 2014—and the significance of it. What felt like confusion and fear back then, I now recognize as a natural and beautiful phase of growing up.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"text-gray-800 text-sm mb-4\">I started with Stayfree, a well-known brand in India. During my BTech, I switched to Bella pads for their soft cotton comfort. Now, I use Saathi’s bamboo + banana fiber pads, and I highly recommend them! They are biodegradable, eco-friendly, and the best product I’ve used for both health and sustainability.</p>\n          </div>\n\n          {/* Right Box - Period Journey */}\n          <div\n            className=\"bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md bg-cover bg-center\"\n            style={{\n              backgroundImage: 'url(\"/images/periodhealth.jpg\")',\n              backgroundSize: 'cover',\n              backgroundPosition: 'center',\n              backgroundBlendMode: 'overlay',\n              backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)' \n            }}\n          >\n            <h3 className=\"text-lg font-semibold mb-4\">My Period Journey: Embracing Strength and Resilience</h3>\n            <p className=\"text-gray-800 text-sm mb-4\">\n              As of today, I’ve completed 124 months of my period journey, with just one cycle missed along the way. Each month brought its own set of challenges, especially with the terrible stomach and back pain I often experienced. Yet, I never let it stop me. No matter how intense the discomfort, I pushed through my daily tasks, proving to myself time and again that resilience is a part of who I am.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"text-gray-800 text-sm mb-4\">\n              My mom has always been my greatest support. She introduced me to simple yet effective home remedies that became my saviors during those tough days—like boiled coriander seeds (dhaniyalu) and a comforting mix of jaggery with ghee. These not only helped ease my pain but also made me feel cared for in the most nurturing way. I also found that staying hydrated and consuming more liquids rather than solid foods made a big difference in how I felt.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"text-gray-800 text-sm mb-4\">\n              My period typically lasts for three days with a moderate flow, during which I lose around 30-60 milliliters of blood—roughly 2-4 spoons. In the early days, the sight of blood made me nervous, but over time, it became a symbol of my strength. Each cycle reminded me that women are incredibly powerful—we nurture, we endure, and we build communities with compassion and strength.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"text-gray-800 text-sm\">\n              This journey has taught me that embracing every part of our experiences, even the painful ones, makes us stronger. It’s a reminder that being a woman means carrying a strength that is both silent and profound.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n      <section className=\"mb-12\">\n      <h2 className=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-6\">\n        Delhi Student's Innovation\n      </h2>\n      <div className=\"bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6\">\n        \n        \n{/* Text Content */}\n<div>\n  <h3 className=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4\">\n    Eco-Friendly Sanitary Pads from Banana Fiber\n  </h3>\n  <p className=\"text-gray-600 text-sm mb-4\">\n    A group of innovative students from Delhi developed eco-friendly sanitary pads made from banana fiber, offering a sustainable and biodegradable solution for menstrual hygiene.
